This folder contains various 'builder' implementations, which take 'source' as an input
and produce an executable.

They could be subdivided into stages like compiling and linking, but the high-level interface is:
In: code
Out: executable.

Implementations for MVP would likely be:
1) nasm + ld
2) some C/C++
3) maybe godbolt API?
4) rustc?
