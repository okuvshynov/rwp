This module will control communication with backend; That would include:
1) Keep-Alive, so that main app knows who's available
2) Polling for new jobs.
3) Submitting the results.

Executors themseleves do not maintain any state between the executions.
All the information on 'what's the status of the run, when do we retry, etc.'
is handled by state transitions in the main app.
